      <p>
      The final assignment for 201B is to create a portfolio of all of your interesting work from this quarter, including at least your collaborative datagram project, your implementation of the set puzzle solver, and your final project research and implementation. Write up an explanation of each of these projects, describing what you were attempting to accomplish, the design choices you made when creating it and why you made them, and the technical and artistic challenges and how they relate to each other. <p>
      The portfolio will be posted as a link on the 201B forum by Friday, Dec. 10th and 11:59pm as a downloadable, zipped folder of html code that can then be placed on the 201B website. Besides the write-up of the projects, it needs to include screenshots, video captures, slides (if appropriate), and a link to the project repos on github. Make sure the repos include a "readme" file that explains clearly how to download, compile, and run the project.
