  	<a class="week">Write a few paragraphs about your programming experience and what you would like to learn.</a> 
	<p>
	I'm interested in getting a sense of what you already know and what you would like to know. 
	Write a paragraph or so about what aspects of programming you are interested in learning. Are there phrases or concepts you have heard of but don't understand fully? Are there topics that I didn't mention during the first day of class that you would like to explore? 1) Post these thoughts to the class forum; 2) Use sftp to upload a text file named <b>(YourName)-thoughts.txt</b> with these thoughts to the mat201b "materials" folder. For example, I would make a file called "AngusForbes-thoughts.txt" by logging in via sftp and doing a put command: <p>
	&gt; sftp your.name@spectrum.mat.ucsb.edu:/mat/sites/201B/materials <br>
	&gt; put AngusForbes-thoughts.txt
	<p> 
	You can also download other people's thoughts, for example:<p>
	&gt; get Some-Student-thoughts.txt	
	<p><br>
  	<a class="week">Create an account on github.com (or another public project hosting repo).</a> 
	<p>

	Sign up for the free account on github (www.github.com), create an ssh-key and add it to your github account (http://help.github.com/mac-key-setup/). There's a good overview of how to use git and manage projects on the github help center (http://help.github.com/).

	<a class="week">Create a simple Processing sketch and save it in a git repo.</a> 
	<p>

	Create an new repo named <b>201B-Processing-Sketches-(YourName)</b>. Then, inside your local repo, create and save a simple Processing sketch named <b>Week1Day1</b>, you can base it on an existing sketch if you are new to Processing. Add the new file(s) to be tracked by git, commit them to the local repository, and then push these commits to the remote github repository. Make some changes and go thorugh the add/commit/push cycle again. <p>

	&gt; git add (filenames)    <i>//this lets git start tracking the files</i><br>
	&gt; git commit -a          <i>//this commits all tracked files to the local repository</i><br>
	&gt; git push               <i>//this pushes the local commits to the remote repository (on github)</i><br>
	<p>
	Post your github.com username and the name of your git repository on the forum so that Javier and I and the other students can take a look at your sketches.
