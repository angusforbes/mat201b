  	<a class="week">Write a few paragraphs about your programming experience and what you would like to learn.</a> 
	<p>
	I'm interested in getting a sense of what you already know and what you would like to know. 
	Write a paragraph or so about what aspects of programming you are interested in learning. Are there phrases or concepts you have heard of but don't understand fully? Are there topics that I didn't mention during the first day of class that you would like to explore? Post these thoughts to the class forum.

  	<a class="week">Create an account on github.com (or another public project hosting repo).</a> 
	<p>

	Sign up for the free account on github (www.github.com), create an ssh-key and add it to your github account (http://help.github.com/mac-key-setup/). There's a good overview of how to use git and manage projects on the github help center (http://help.github.com/).

	<a class="week">Create a simple Processing sketch and save it in a git repo.</a> 
	<p>

	Create an new repo named <b>201B-Processing-Sketches-(YourName)</b>. Then, inside your local repo, create and save a simple Processing sketch named <b>Week1Day1</b>, you can base it on an existing sketch if you are new to Processing. Add the new file(s) to be tracked by git, commit them to the local repository, and then push these commits to the remote github repository. <p>

	That is:<br>
	&gt; git add (filenames)    <i>//this lets git start tracking the files</i><br>
	&gt; git commit -a          <i>//this automatically adds or removes all tracked files to the local repository</i><br>
	&gt; git push               <i>//this pushes the local changes to the remote repository (on github)</i><br>
