  	<a class="week">Terminal scavenger hunt</a> <p>
	If you weren't able to finish the <a href="Quiz1.html">terminal scavenger hunt</a> in class, please do so before the next class.

	<a class="week">Command research</a> 
	<p>
	Using the powers of Google, the man command, and your ability to change directories, investigate the meaning of 3 programs that are in your PATH. Find 1 command which is (at least potentially) useful, 1 command which is odd, and 1 command which doesn't make sense. For example, in /usr/bin there is a command called "ypcat". I have no idea what this does. Reading the man page tells me that it was written by Theo De Raadt in 1993 and that it prints out all of the commands in a YP database. Hmm.
	<p>   Write up a brief report describing what each of your 3 commands do and what useful options they take and post to the Command research thread in the 201B forum. 
	<p>&nbsp;<br>
	
	<a class="week">Extend the Monster template sketch</a> (due 10/5/10 before class starts)
	<p>
	Copy the code from the MonsterSketchTemplate folder and add it to a new folder inside of your ProcessingSketches repo. Call it something obvious like "MonsterSketchYourName" and make sure you rename the main Processing file and class accordingly.
	<p>
	Add at least 1 new property and 1 new method to the Monster class. 
	<p> 
	Add 3 new classes that extend from the base Monster class (and that make use of the property and method you just added.)
	<p>
	Edit the "setup" method so that it instantiates some of these monsters and make sure that the "draw" method correctly draws your monsters to the screen.	
	<p>
	Add and Commit all changes to your local repo (as often as you want!) and finally Push your changes to your remote repo before the deadline.
