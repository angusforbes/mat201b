  	<a class="week">GUI / library research / OO code</a><p>
	
	Make an Object-oriented Java program (using the Processing libraries) that is controlled by GUI elements. The program must have at least 1 of each of the following interface elements: a slider, a button, a checkbox, and a textfield. The interface elements should control parameters that affect the audio and/or visual output of your program. For extra credit, create an innovative interface element of your own. 
	<p>
	Write a short explanation of: 1) the Processing library you chose; 2) in what ways your code is object-oriented; and 3) the functionality of your GUI widgets. Submit the code to your github account as a brand new repo called (Initials)-ProcessingGUI-201B. For instance, my project would be called "AF-ProcessingGUI-201B." Post your write up and the address of the git repo to the class forums. Your project should include a simple bash script that compiles and runs the code.

	<a class="week">Java Swing / Graphics 2D code</a><p>
	Make a simple Java program with two panels. The first panel will contain one or more Swing GUI widgets. The second panel will override paintComponent(Graphics g) to make use of the Java Graphics library. The GUI widgets in the first panel should alter the drawing in the second panel. Submit the code to your github account as a brand new repo called (Initials)-SwingGUI-201B. For instance, my project would be called "AF-SwingGUI-201B." You don't need to submit a write up, but include a bash script that compiles and runs the code.
