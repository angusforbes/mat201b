	<a class="week">Set Puzzle Implementation</a><p>
	  You will create a graphical implementation of the Set Puzzle game using OpenGL. The user will be presented with a board containing 12 cards in a legal configuration (i.e., no card is used twice). Users will be able to select 3 cards and receive feedback as to whether or not they have chosen a legal set. 


      <div class="topic"> 
	<a class="week">Set Puzzle Solver</a><p>
	At the beginning of class you will be given a text file with game data representing each of the 12 cards in a Set puzzle. Your program must search these cards and find all 6 of the legal sets in the shortest amount of steps. As a benchmark, you can create a brute-force seach algorithm to compare against your more optimal search algorithm. 

	Each card will be encoded in text file on its own line with 4 characters. <br>
	Character 1 = {1,2,3}  //to indicate One, Two, or Three shapes. <br>
	Character 2 = {R,G,B}  //to indcate a Red, Green, or Blue coloring. <br>
	Character 3 = {S,D,P}  //to indcate a Squiggle, Diamond, or Pill shape. <br>
	Character 4 = {O,C,H}  //to indcate Open, Closed, or Half-filled shading.<br>

	<p>
	For instance, a file might look like this:

	1RSO
	1GSH...

	A test file you can use to test your solver can be found here: [<a href=""></a><br>]. But please note that the competition will use a different file, so please make sure and test your solver under many different board configurations.
