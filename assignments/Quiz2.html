      You are the instructor for a course in Programming. One of your assignments involves creating a program that makes use of the Processing libraries from within a small Java project and that compiles and executes via a simple bash script. A student named Angus approaches you 15 minutes before class starts with tears in his eyes. He has some code that doesn't compile and pleads for your help. Download his code from http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/201B/code/debug.tar and help Angus to get his code to compile and run. Make a list of all of the errors that you find in his code so that you remember to review concepts that will help him write error-free code in the future. In particular, explain the meaning of abstract, static, public, and private keywords, and the proper syntax for initializing arrays, using for-loops, how to define instance variables, and how to call a class's methods.
