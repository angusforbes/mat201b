      <p>
      The final project will be presented in two stages, a brief research presentation and a longer presentation that demonstrates an implementation of your project. You are free to choose any project you like, as long as it involves some of the programming concepts and/or media libraries we covered this quarter.

	For the reserach presentation portion of the final project, you will describe your project in terms of its relation to the techincal and/or artistic aspects of existing research or explorations. Provide an overview of your intended final project; provide contextualization by briefly outlining similar works and explaining how your work differs from, extends from, and improves upon previous work. Your 10 minute powerpoint presentation will include an overview of software tools and libraries you will use to create your project. Be prepared to answer questions related to the conceptual and techincal components of your presentaiton. Slides are due at the beginning of class.

	<a class="week">Implementation</a><br>due 12/9/10<p>
	The final presentation will be centered around a successful implementation of the project proposed in the previous research presentation. In addition to demonstrating your implementation, your 20 minute presentation will discuss the design decisions you made in creating the project and also explain the technical components of your software. A link (posted to the class forum) to a final zipped folder containing a 201B portfolio web page that includes the code and description of the collaborative experiment, your algorithms assignment, the research project, and the project implementation is due on 12/10/10 at midnight.
